Robotic FAQ

1. Which Arduino IDE version to use for coding?
- Arduino IDE 2.0.4 and above

2. While installing software, its ask for the installing multiple drivers?
- Allow all the drivers to install along with the software installation process.  

3. I am not able to open the Arduino file in Arduino IDE Software?
- First Solution >> open Arduino IDE Software >> Goto File option >> Select open >> now you can select your file and click on open.
- Second Solution >> Right click on the Arduino file >> Select open with option >> open in Notepad >> Select entire code and copy the code >> open Arduino IDE Software >> >> Goto File option >> Select New File >> Delete the pre written code and paste the copied code.

4. What are the differences between Serial.print() and Serial.println() ?
- Both Serial.print() and Serial.println() prints number, string to Serial Monitor. Serial.println() will print next number or string on new line.

5. What are the differences between digitalWrite() and analogWrite() ?
- digitalWrite() function controls Arduino's pin to LOW or HIGH. Accordingly, we can use the function to turn ON/OFF LED, DC Motor, etc. AnalogWrite() function generates PWM signal to Arduino's pin. Accordingly, we can use this function to control brightness of LED, speed of DC Motor.

6. Error description: expected',' or ';' before

Error Message in IDE: C:\Users\Documents\Arduino\Code\Code.ino: In function 'void setup()':
draft:4:3: error: expected ',' or ';' before 'Serial'
   Serial.println(myVal);
   ^~~~~~
exit status 1
expected ',' or ';' before 'Serial'

- This is a common mistake for beginners who just got started to learn programming. It is very easy to solve. You just need to put semicolon(;) at the end of the line.

7. Error description: Arduino board is connected to laptop / computer, port for board is also configured. But getting the following error.

Error Message in IDE: Arduino: 1.8.19 (Windows 10), Board: "Arduino Uno"

Sketch uses 444 bytes (1%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
Global variables use 9 bytes (0%) of dynamic memory, leaving 2039 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
An error occurred while uploading the sketch
avrdude: ser_open(): can't open device "\\.\COM27": The system cannot find the file specified.

- Sometimes, board doesn't connect to laptop / computer properly. Remove the USB Cable from the Arduino Board and Laptop / Computer and connect back. Try to upload code again.
